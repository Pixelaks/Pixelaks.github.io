      <p>
        By downloading or using the game, these terms will automatically apply to you – you should make sure therefore
        that you read them carefully before using the game. You’re not allowed to copy, or modify the games that we
        created, any part of the game, or our trademarks in any way. You’re not allowed to attempt to extract the source
        code of the game, and you also shouldn’t try to translate the game into other languages, or make derivative
        versions. The game itself, and all the trade marks, copyright, database rights and other intellectual property
        rights related to it, still belong to Pixelaks Games.
        <br>
        The games That we created maybe stores and processes personal data that you have provided to us, in order to
        provide our Service. It’s your responsibility to keep your phone and access to the game secure. We therefore
        recommend that you do not jailbreak or root your phone, which is the process of removing software restrictions
        and limitations imposed by the official operating system of your device. It could make your phone vulnerable to
        malware/viruses/malicious programs, compromise your phone’s security features and it could mean that the Our
        games won’t work properly or at all.
        <br>
        You should be aware that there are certain things that Pixelaks Games will not take responsibility for. Certain
        functions of the game will require the game to have an active internet connection. The connection can be Wi-Fi,
        or provided by your mobile network provider, but AksGames cannot take responsibility for the game not working at
        full functionality if you don’t have access to Wi-Fi, and you don’t have any of your data allowance left.
        <br>
        If you’re using the game outside of an area with Wi-Fi, you should remember that your terms of the agreement
        with your mobile network provider will still apply. As a result, you may be charged by your mobile provider for
        the cost of data for the duration of the connection while accessing the game, or other third party charges. In
        using the game, you’re accepting responsibility for any such charges, including roaming data charges if you use
        the game outside of your home territory (i.e. region or country) without turning off data roaming. If you are
        not the bill payer for the device on which you’re using the game, please be aware that we assume that you have
        received permission from the bill payer for using the game.
        <br>
        Along the same lines, Pixelaks Games cannot always take responsibility for the way you use the game i.e. You need to
        make sure that your device stays charged – if it runs out of battery and you can’t turn it on to avail the
        Service, Pixelaks Games cannot accept responsibility.
        <br>
        With respect to Pixelaks Games’s responsibility for your use of the game, when you’re using the game, it’s important
        to bear in mind that although we endeavour to ensure that it is updated and correct at all times, we do rely on
        third parties to provide information to us so that we can make it available to you. Pixelaks Games accepts no
        liability for any loss, direct or indirect, you experience as a result of relying wholly on this functionality
        of the game.
        <br>
        At some point, we may wish to update the game. The game is currently available on Android & iOS – the
        requirements for both systems (and for any additional systems we decide to extend the availability of the game
        to) may change, and you’ll need to download the updates if you want to keep playing the game. Pixelaks Games does not
        promise that it will always update the game so that it is relevant to you and/or works with the Android & iOS
        version that you have installed on your device. However, you promise to always accept updates to the game when
        offered to you, We may also wish to stop providing the game, and may terminate use of it at any time without
        giving notice of termination to you. Unless we tell you otherwise, upon any termination, (a) the rights and
        licenses granted to you in these terms will end; (b) you must stop using the game, and (if needed) delete it
        from your device.
